# gdp_inspector
### Task description.
Please write a class that takes the path of the gdp.csv and population.csv datasets.
The class will injest the csv files and then be able to answer the following questions through functions:

- Latest GDP of a country
- GDP per capita of a country
- last function, is gdp per capita growth by country in the last X year. gdp_per_capita_growth(country, years)

I know some of these aren't countries, but regions, but for the sake of this exercise they are all countries.
